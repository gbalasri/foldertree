Dear user,

This app fetches the records from api to build the folder structure.

1. Click on the Folder Page Home icon in the top nav bar to redirect to the root directory at any point
2. The first page displays the root level folders which has no parent(null).
3. Clicking on any folder item in the root level redirects you to the list of subfolders 
and files under the selected folder.
4. The subfolder page is sorted to display the folders at first followed by the file types, 
similar to windows folder explorer.
5. If you select on the file or any folder which has no content then a message is displayed 
on screen on the same.
6. The fetch method is applied to get the data from api every 30 seconds and during page navigation 
as per the requirement given.

Thank you! Have a nice day!
